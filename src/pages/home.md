You can store the template to inherit in a variable and use it by omitting quotes. This variable can contain a string that points to a template file, or it can contain a compiled Template object that has been added to the context. That way you can dynamically change which template is inherited when rendering by setting it in the context.

## Toolbelt

- **Eleventy v2@latest**
  - `.njk` templates with template inheritance
- **TailwindCSS@latest**
  - with _prose_ plugin
- **AlpineJS@latest**
  - with _persist_ plugin
